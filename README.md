*Verification of Neural Networks using the [DeepZ](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/publications/singh2018effective) framework*

The task is to extend the [DeepZ](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/publications/singh2018effective) framework by incorporating parameterized Zonotope abstractions to provide a learnable verification environment for MLP's and ConvNets.
